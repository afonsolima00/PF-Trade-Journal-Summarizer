== Entry ==
Long Kaito at 1.65, 21/02/2025, 09:00 AM UTC, margin 50,000, leverage 1.

== Exit ==
Closed 21/02/2025, 11:30 AM UTC, ~$6000 profit.

== Rationale ==
Long Kaito as TGE coins (Bera, IP) are in a mini bull market; up 50% from launch with strong momentum, attention, and fundamentals (staking, rev share). Missed IP yesterday, but Kaito looks promisingâ€”will buy more if lower. Closed profitably, may reopen if it dips.
